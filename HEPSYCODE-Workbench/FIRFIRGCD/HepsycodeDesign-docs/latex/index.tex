Hepsycode is a prototypal tool to improve the design time of embedded applications. It is based on a System-\/\+Level methodology for H\+W/\+SW Co-\/\+Design of Heterogeneous Parallel Dedicated Systems. The whole framework drives the designer from an Electronic System-\/\+Level (E\+SL) behavioral model, with related NF requirements, including real-\/time and mixed-\/criticality ones, to the final H\+W/\+SW implementation, considering specific HW technologies, scheduling policies and Inter-\/\+Process Communication (I\+PC) mechanisms. The system behavior modeling language introduced in Hepsycode, named H\+ML (H\+E\+P\+SY Modeling Language), is based on the Communicating Sequential Processes (C\+SP) Model of Computation (MoC). It allows modeling the behavior of the system as a network of processes communicating through unidirectional synchronous channels. By means of H\+ML it is possible to specify the System Behavior Model (S\+BM), an executable model of the system behavior, a set of Non Functional Constraints (N\+FC) and a set of Reference Inputs (RI) to be used for simulation-\/based activities. Through the execution of different steps, including a system-\/level Design Space Exploration (D\+SE) approach that allows the related co-\/design methodology to suggest an H\+W/\+SW partitioning of the application specification and a mapping of the partitioned entities onto an automatically defined heterogeneous multi-\/processor architecture, it is possible to proceed with system implementation.

Hepsycode uses Eclipse M\+DE technologies, SystemC custom simulator implementation and an evolutionary genetic algorithm for partitioning activities, all integrated into an automatic framework that drive the designer from first input to final solution.\hypertarget{index_WEBSITE}{}\doxysubsection{W\+E\+B\+S\+I\+TE}\label{index_WEBSITE}

We provide an example Hepsycode project, called Fir\+Fir\+G\+CD (F\+FG). F\+FG is a synthetic application that takes in input pairs of values (triggered by Stimulus), makes two filtering actions (F\+I\+R8 and F\+I\+R16) and then makes the Greatest Common Divisor (G\+CD) between the filters outputs and displays the result. This application is composed of three main components\+: 2 Finite Impulse Response (F\+IR) digital filters and a Greatest Common Divisor (G\+CD) component, as show in the figure below.
